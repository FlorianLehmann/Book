# How do developer introduce themselves to open source projects and correct bugs in them ?

_**Questions:**_

1. How do developers contribute to each others bug corrections?
2. How do contributions of developers evolve over time?
3. Does bug correction add complexity to the code when it isn't done by the former developer?
4. How long do bugs remain in open-source codes?

_**Projects to study:**_

Long projects with new developers in them. The open source projects are a good sudy case because there is often many move, developers start to contribut to the project and other stop to contribut. We should have many data to analyse the developers attitude.

We will study the [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic) project
