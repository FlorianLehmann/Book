## I. Introduction {#docs-internal-guid-dafa870e-d890-ce14-9ccb-c01eaed7a9ca}

As part of the RIMEL module, our group realized this study which is interested in machines learning. Firstly, we will present our research context, then our general question, then our hypothesis and the experiences that we made, finally we conclude.

## II. Research context {#docs-internal-guid-ab546d41-d891-03dd-3c8b-3178318695d6}

Machine learning is the principle of using big volumes of data to train machines to perform certain tasks like image recognition.

It is possible to categorized machine learning tasks by looking at the desired output, we will call them “algorithm families” and focus on those 4 families:

* Regression

  * The output is continuous

* Clusterers

  * The output is multiple data groups not know beforehand

* Classifiers

  * The output is multiple data groups that was know beforehand

* Classifiers-regression

  * Some algorithm can be used for multiple purposes
