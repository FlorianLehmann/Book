# What about the team structure ?

### _Intro:_

This study tries to compare the a  model of an ideal team, based on Conwayâ€™s law, to a real company team. In this article we will expose some criterias of the Spring.io team structure.

First of all, we need to extract the team from the website project. To achieve this, we choose to develop our **own **extractor, in few word: given a webpage, we can by **parsing **the tags catch the information needed.

Extract tool is available at [RIMEL-extractor](http://rimel.dobl.fr/) \([http://rimel.dobl.fr/\](http://rimel.dobl.fr/\)\)

With the extractor tool you can:

* Enter a webpage which reference a team \(e.g. [https://spring.io/team\](https://spring.io/team\)\)
* See the list of team members
* The Map will shows you their location
* The grid shows you their team position \(e.g. Developer\)
* Sort by Name, Position, Location, Github name

We can now analyse the team by considering some metrics: the projects that Spring team develop, the projects locations and the team positionning.
