# Modularity in Video Games

In this chapter, it will be discussed "_how can video games \(and more generally, software\) be modular thanks to the addition of 'mods' or 'plugins' ?_". This can be the wish of the development team, or driven by the community playing the video game \(or using the software\).



_**Questions :**_

* How can a community impact the development of some features ?

_**Projects to study :**_
