_**Introduction:**_

Melvin Conway introduced the idea in 1967 at the National Symposium on Modular Programming.** It states that :**

> _Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations - M. Conway_

We try to verify the validity of this assumption by studying the structure of Spring project team and comparing the results to the code commits.

## Introduction

In 1967, Melvin Conway introduced at the National Symposium on Modular Programming the idea that “Organizations which design systems \[...\] are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”. A rule that was true at this time, but with the propagation of open source philosophy, we want to know if it’s respected.

Open-source projects are a quite recent evolution in informatic with the propagation of free repository hosting like github \(launched the 10th April of 2008\). In big open-source projects, there is a mix of external contributors and a core internal team both contributing, that doesn’t know each other, something far from what could have imagined Conway at his era when there was only static teams.

We want to know if the current teams of open sources projects have the same organization than the one we could extract from the code. Looking at the code and the commits of a Version Control System \(VCS\), we could extract a design that, according to Conway, should be a copy of the real team.

If we find that the team created using the organizations informations and the team created using the code source is the same, we could conclude that Conway’s Law is valid.

We chose Spring because it’s a set of Open Source projects on which we have informations on the current teams. We can also link from their website the team members location and get their github account to have more informations. That’s why these projects are perfect for our study.
