# **What is the impact of the structure \(teams organisation\) on the code and vice versa ?**

_**Team:**_

* Dorian BLANC
* Fabien VICENTE
* Manuel PAVONE
* Tom DALL'AGNOL

_**Tools: **_

* GitHub API
* TeamCodeParser \(Made by us, allows, given a Github repository \(ex: github.com/spring-io/sagan\), to extract the team by **code exploration**\)
* TeamParser \(Made by us, allows, given a webpage \(ex: spring.io/team\), to extract teams by **subject **and **location**\)

_**Project to study: **_

* [Spring](https://spring.io/)

_**Questions: **_

* Extract the code and analyze it to determine the perfect team. 
* Verify the suitability between the ideal teams and those extracted from the project documentation.

_**Introduction:**_

Melvin Conway introduced the idea in 1967 at the National Symposium on Modular Programming.** It states that :**

_Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations - M. Conway_

We try to verify the validity of this assumption by studying the structure of Spring project team and comparing the results to the code commits.
