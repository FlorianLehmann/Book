# Background on tools : What are the impacts of Test-Driven Development on code quality, code maintainability and test coverage ?

## Used tools

### SonarQube[^1]

We will use SonarQube, a tool to analyse projects and to find metrics such as code smell, cyclomatic complexity or duplicated lines of code. This tool can also show the code coverage but we don't know yet how to use this functionality.

Here is a preview of an analysis of the TDD project Fitness made by SonarQube.![](/assets/sonar.png)
