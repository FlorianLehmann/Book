## **Questions**

Analysis of a large-scale multi-language software system applied to NodeJS

To perform this analysis, we will answer the following questions using a number of appropriate tools.

* Is the organization of teams linked to different languages ?

* Are there people responsible for several modules developed in C ++ and Javascript?

* Are there people who work more specifically on the interconnection between these two languages?

## **Tools and Methods**

To understand how teams organize themselves in this project and its possible link with different languages, we will start by looking the history of its evolution through the commits. Then we will use codeMaat to analyze the data collected previously in order to determine the structural organization in the project. _\(@mbf : Explain what do you mean by structural organization\)_

Once we have the organizational metrics, we will be able to find developers who work on several modules written in different languages. To do this, we will use both codeMaat . The option ownership provided among others by codeMaat will enable us to identify the developers who work on the modules developed in different languages, the percentage of their contributions to different modules, major developers, etc .... _\(@mbf: Gitinspector? pourquoi faire?\)_

We will use TreeMap to refine and visualize the results generated by CodeMaat. By combining all these tools we will be able to answer these different questions.

From the results that we will obtain, we will look more specifically if there are people who work mainly to the interconnection between these two languages \(C ++, JavaScript\).

Finally we will see if the structural organization of the project is indeed Conway's law, if this is the case we will build the architecture according to the two languages.

## **Results**

Our first analysis of the repository node allowed us to identify the different contributors to the modules written in the different languages, the distribution of their effort, those who contribute the most.Below the first results we got.

## E**ncountered difficulties **

The difficulty we have encountered is that we are analyzing a large-scale software system developed mainly in C ++ and Javascript. Besides this, NodeJs includes a large number of modules in which one can find hundreds of files.
